		<p> FIA is the regulator os this sport. F1 cars have been getting bigger and bigger this past years, making quality racing go down and overtaking more and more difficult. With the new car, the dimensions have been reduced, so they are more manageable, as well as dirty air (or slipstream), making chasing and overtaking easier and fair. FIA has also introduced some changes in fuel efficiency, in a joint effort with the constructor's engineering team to drive the sport towards a more sustainable and ecofriendly future.</p>

		<p>You are not a F1 fan yet? We recommend you watch Netflix's Drive to Survive documentary. Here you have the trailer of the series. It is a great documentary, watch it over Christmas and get on board with F1. By the time you finish it next season will be just about to start!</p>
